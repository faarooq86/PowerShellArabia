Active Directory PowerShell module is an awesome module which allows system admins to manage, control and automate the daily boring tasks. But the problem with great power is the great responsibility.

You can’t simply give access to the non-technical teams or the less technical folks to run scripts, this will bring tragedy to your environment.

But no worries, Scriptrunner is here, the ultimate solution that allows system admins to convert all the PowerShell scripts into web services and delegate them to the non-technical and less technical folks easily.

In this session with Mr. Heiko from ScriptRunner we will show you all how to convert your regular PowerShell scripts into web-based tasks and delegate it.


Heiko is PowerShell enthusiast and Product Expert at ScriptRunner - The PowerShell Management Company. He has been working in the IT industry for more than 25 years in several different roles like IT administrator, consultant and product manager. 
In his free time, he is very much into music, and you see (and hear!) him playing drums in the office occasionally.

### PowerShell and ScriptRunner – Develop/Manage and Delegate PowerShell Scripts

PowerShell is an awesome framework for automating recurring tasks but, it requires three things:

    1. PowerShell know-how
    2. Time to write scripts
    3. Backend permissions to run scripts in your on-premises, hybrid or cloud environment.

These three requirements typically limit the use of PowerShell to IT administrators and IT Pros.

Now, what if you could take your code and delegate the script execution to helpdesk teams and end users?

What if your scripts, modules and credentials could be centrally managed and a web GUI could be created automatically without any additional code?

In this session, Heiko Brenn will show you how ScriptRunner does just that by simplifying the way you develop, manage and delegate PowerShell scripts.
